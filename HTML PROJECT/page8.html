If you're going to bulk up, lose fat, or stay healthy, you'll also need a goal-specific meal <br>
plan to get results. We've created templates to help you do all three, along with <br>
guidelines to help you track the calories, carbs, protein, and fat you should be shooting <br>
for each day.<br>
Stock your fridge and pantry with the foods outlined in our grocery lists to whip up <br>
delicious, nutritious meals all year. To get you started, we've also included sample <br>
recipes, plus plenty of options to swap in for added variety. This is your one-stop shop <br>
for what and how to eat in the new year.<br>
The composition of your meals will be determined by your goals and the timing of your <br>
weight training. The meals in our New Year's plan are divided into two categories: those <br>
with starchy carbs and those without.</h3>

<h1>Grocery List</h1>
<h3>You'll need to eat more starchy carbs and fewer fats before and after workouts to <br>
promote energy and muscle growth. If you're training to pack on size, you'll eat like this <br>
more frequently. And when you're hours removed from a workout, you'll limit starches <br>
and increase fats, which will keep you on track to meet your fat-loss goals. For meals <br>
containing starchy carbohydrates, your meal options include:</h3><h3><ul type="disk">
<li><b>Starches:</b>Brown rice, quinoa, yams, potatoes, oats, whole-wheat pastas, bread, cereals, wraps</li>
<li><b>Protein:</b>Protein powders, egg whites, whole eggs (sparingly), white meat, white fish, Greek yogurt</li>
<li><b>Fruits/Vegetables/Legumes:</b>Tropical fruits, green/fibrous vegetables, beans</li>
<li><b>Oils:</b>Use sparingly; think teaspoons, not tablespoons</li>
<li>For meals not containing starchy carbohydrates, your options are:</li>
<li><b>Protein:</b>Protein powders, eggs, white meat, red meat, oily fish or white fish, Greek yogurt</li>
<li><b>Fruits/Vegetables/Legumes:</b>Berries, green/fibrous, beans (sparingly)</li>
<li><b>Oils/Fats:</b>Tablespoons, not teaspoons. Avocados, nuts/seeds, coconut oil, canola <br>
mayonnaise, full-fat cheeses</li></h3>
</ul>

<h1>5 PILLARS OF NUTRITION</h1>
<h3><ol type="1">
<li><b>Eat Six Times A Day:</b>Fuel your body with multiple small meals and snacks each day <br>
to keep your blood-sugar levels under control and your metabolism steady and to <br>
stimulate the production of new muscle.</li>
<li><b>Limit Processed Foods:</b>Whether it comes in a box, a carton, or a bag, if it's got a <br>
label or brand name, it's likely highly processed and not worth eating. Remove <br>
these high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods from your life and you'll be much more likely <br>
to stick to your New Year's resolutions.</li>
<li><b>Stay Hydrated:</b>Drink water and calorie-free beverages to keep your performance in <br>
the gym at its peak. Avoid sugar-laden drinks that will fatten your waistline and <br>
sabotage your body's antioxidant defense systems.</li>
<li><b>Strategic Carbs:</b>Carbs come in two forms—starchy, faster-acting options such as <br>
rice, bread, and pasta, which raise blood sugar quickly; and non-starchy carbs such <br>
as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which are higher in fiber and raise blood <br>
sugar gradually. Non-starchy carbs are rarely a problem. Enjoy them! The timing of <br>
when you eat starchy carbs, on the other hand, is key to getting and maintaining a <br>
lean and muscular body. Eat them either first thing in the morning or directly after <br>
your workouts and your body is more likely to use them to help refuel your energy <br>
reserves.</li>
<li><b>Lean Protein:</b>Give your body a protein infusion every couple of hours to maximize <br>
muscle growth while stimulating the release of fat-burning hormones. The best <br>
sources include lean beef, chicken, fish, lower-fat dairy foods, and soy. While whole <br>
foods should always be your first choice, a quality protein powder can be used in <br>conjunction with your diet to make sure you meet your protein macros each day. <br>
Consider adding a whey protein or two between meals, and use slow-digesting <br>
casein protein to fuel your gains at night while you sleep.</li></h3>
</ol>
<h1>The Beginner Meal Plan</h1>
<img src="img32.jpg" height="300" width="45%" align="right">
<h2><b>Target:</b>2,500 calories, 218 g carbs, 218 g protein, 83 g fat</h2>
<h3>If you want to stay healthy and have more energy, this is the plan for you. It's relatively<br>
low in carbs and very high in protein, and it emphasizes antioxidant-rich foods to <br>
improve the health of your blood vessels while also warding off inflammation—two <br>
factors that accelerate the rate at which every cell in your body ages.</h3>
